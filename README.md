NIF wrapper for libart

This is the just a first quick & dirty version of the NIF. This is intended to be tested as memory storage for Lepasight Semantic Dataspace (http://leapsight.com/what_we_do.html). 

TODO:
- Check there's no memory leaks.
- Sanitise Erlang API and NIF code.
- Add missing functions wrappers.
- Adapt insert and search functions to take arbitrary terms and not just binaries.
- Test, test, test.
